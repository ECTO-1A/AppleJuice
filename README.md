# Apple BLE Proximity Pairing Message Spoofing

~ **Update 8/31/23** ~

I have combined all messages into a single app. You can now run `app.py` to get a list of available options.<br>
To run the script use `-d (number of message)`  *example* `app.py -d 13` <br>
*See Usage section below for more info*

# Disclaimer

These scripts are an experimental PoC that uses Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to send proximity pairing messages to Apple devices.

# About This Project

This was created in response to the various AppleTV spoof messages being sent out during [DEF CON 31](https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/14/researcher-says-they-were-behind-iphone-popups-at-def-con/). After experiencing it first hand, I had to figure out what was happening. The existing research projects I could find *see credits* had great info but were both a couple years out of date with broken package dependancies, so I decided to take what I could from them and start building from there. 

*This is a work in progress, its only been two weeks since it was launched / showcased at DEF CON and I think I've made some decent progress in getting this working as simply as possible for everyone.  I'll eventually go back and re-work some of the more technical parts of the original projects but wanted to get something fun out there that people can start playing with right away.*

# Hardware Requirements

To run these scripts you need a Linux machine with an internal Bluetooth card or a USB Bluetooth adapter.

All original testing was done on a Lenovo T480 with a built-in Bluetooth adapter.\
Later tested on Raspberry Pi 3B+ running Kali Linux with a [Zexmte Long Range USB Bluetooth 5.1 Adapter with Dual Antenna](https://zexmte.com/collections/bluetooth-adapter/products/plug-play-long-range-bluetooth-5-1-usb-adapter).<br><br>

With the Lenovo computer running Kali Linux using the internal Bluetooth, the messages would only reach devices within a couple feet of the machine. 

With the Raspberry Pi and long range Bluetooth adapter, I'm able to get 20+ feet of range indoors in an area with loads of BLE traffic and noise. Outdoor range should be much greater but remains to be tested.

# Installation Instructions
Please follow in this exact order or you might run into issues with bluetooth dependencies.

**Clone the Main Repo**\
`git clone https://github.com/ECTO-1A/AppleJuice.git && cd ./AppleJuice`

**Install dependancies**\
`sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y bluez libpcap-dev libev-dev libnl-3-dev libnl-genl-3-dev libnl-route-3-dev cmake libbluetooth-dev`

**Install pybluez && pycryptodome**\
The pybluez library is broken on Github and needs to be installed manually
  - download the latest version from `pip install git+https://github.com/pybluez/pybluez.git#egg=pybluez`
  - pycrypto is not maintained but you can install pycryptodome and it will work `pip install pycryptodome`

**Install Requirements**\
`sudo pip install -r requirements.txt`

**To Run Scripts Without Sudo**\
To be able to run without sudo, you need to set the capabilities of the python binary to allow it to access raw sockets. This is done with the following command:

`sudo setcap cap_net_raw,cap_net_admin+eip $(eval readlink -f $(which python))`

**Reboot Machine**\
Several users have reported the need for a reboot after installing the bluetooth packages in order for everything to work properly.

# Usage

Before running the script, check that your Bluetooth adapter is connected and showing as `hci0`\
Run `hcitool dev` to get a list of connected adapters
```
hcitool dev
Devices:
    hci0    00:00:7C:00:3A:13
```
*If the adapter is showing as* `hci1` *you will need to edit the* `dev_id` *variable in the scripts to match*

*Update 8/31/23*<br>

I have combined all messages into a single app. You can now run `app.py` to get a list of available options.<br>
To run the script use `-d (number of message)`  *example* `app.py -d 13`<br>
```
python3 app.py
Please select a message option using -d.
Available message options:
1: Airpods
2: Airpods Pro
3: Airpods Max
4: Airpods Gen 2
